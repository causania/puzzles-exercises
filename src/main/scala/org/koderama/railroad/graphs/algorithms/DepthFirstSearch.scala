/**
 * Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching a tree, tree structure, or graph.
 * One starts at the root (selecting some node as the root in the graph case)
 * and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
 *
 * There are different algorithms to traver a graph.
 * Even a matrix representation can be used, where position i,j represents the edge for nodes i and j.
 *
 * This implementation is a more general implementation of the DFS, it allows several searching heuristics.
 *
 *
 * This class is thread safe as long as the given graph is.
 *
 * @see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search
 *
 *
 * @param graph The related graph where the search will be performed. Notice that it's expected a graph where nodes
 * have an unique label.
 * @tparam N the type of the node value
 * @tparam E the type of the edge value. Values are expected to be numbers in order to be able to calculate the cost.
